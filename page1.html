              Loki's first major appearance in the MCU was as the primary

              Loki led a Chitauri invasion, showcasing his power and strategic
              brilliance. This moment not only established him as a formidable
              adversary but also laid the groundwork for his ongoing character
              arc.

              This revelation adds a layer of complexity to Loki's character,
              explaining his feelings of inadequacy and fueling his desire for
              power and acceptance.
